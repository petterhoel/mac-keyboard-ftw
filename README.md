# mac-keyboard-ftw

A mac centric keyboard **_for the windows_**. One keyboard layout to unite them all, or at least both.

Going between macOS and Windows systems is a pain. A US international layout supporting Norwegian typists with Æ, Ø and Å labels.

Symbols > text.

This is for WASD keyboards.
